### Disclaimer

I'm not a tax professional, accountant, or financial advisor. I am not even retired. This blog post is for informational and educational purposes only. It's not intended to be a substitute for personalized and professional tax advice.

### Chart

I created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_nkRUMTlXDGkEafr9_s8jEyAyMrmv1DGrK7Otn53x4/edit?usp=sharing) that combines [the provincial and federal tax brackets for British Columbia](https://www.taxtips.ca/taxrates/bc.htm) with [the clawback on Old Age Security Benefits](https://www.taxtips.ca/seniors/oas-clawback.htm). This was done to determine the **effective** *marginal* tax rate for high-income seniors in British Columbia.

![Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSSaZFclKv2D7e8AZg7aS2xNuOqn5S4lqX9ugmk3u5mSHN9EhRxU2humrn5X3heONwvMGy8fs_opbRZ/pubchart?oid=589782588&format=image)

**Note** that this chart assumes that Old Age Security has been delayed until age 70 and the recipient is eligible for the maximum amount.

### Observation

An interesting observation from the chart is the decline in the effective marginal tax rate at $172,624, which is the income level where Old Age Security benefits are fully clawed back. This shows that the income tax system for seniors is not *perfectly* [progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax). One implication is that high-income seniors may end up paying less tax on average if they are able to strategically stagger their income over multiple years.

### Hypothetical Scenario

Let's consider two hypothetical retirees, Bob and Alice.

Both of them:
* Are in their early 70s.
* Want travel while they are still young; 70 is the new 60!
* Spend $110,000 per year.
* Receive $24,000 per year from the Canadian Pension Plan.
* Delayed Old Age Security until they were 70 years old.
* Have $1,000,000 in their Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF).

To cover her annual spending, Alice withdraws $130,800 from her RRIF each year. She pays $45,693 in income tax, and only receives $3,144 from Old Age Security because $8,732 was clawed back.

Bob, on the other hand, staggers his withdrawals:

* In **odd** years, he withdraws $196,253 from his RRIF. He pays $75,087 in income tax, and receives no Old Age Security, because it is entirely clawed back.

* In **even** years, he withdraws $57,578 from his RRIF. He pays $18,618 in income tax, and receives the full $11,876 from Old Age Security, as none of it is clawed back.

Note that both Alice and Bob are able to spend $110,000 per year on average. However, Alice has to withdraw $130,800 from her RRIF every year, whereas Bob only has to withdraw an average of $126,916 per year.

Please note that this hypothetical was carefully chosen to illustrate the potential tax savings and the outcome is **not** generalizable to all levels of taxable income; tax rates for seniors are *mostly* progressive, after all.

### Conclusion

The hypothetical case of Bob and Alice uses RRIF withdrawals to demonstrate how staggering taxable income in retirement *could* lower total tax paid, but there's nothing special about RRIFs for this purpose; any type of taxable income that you have some control over is potentially in play.

I believe that this also means the conventional wisdom around pension income splitting (i.e., that it's beneficial to shift income from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse) may not be universally applicable.
